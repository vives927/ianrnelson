                    <p>I am a limited licensed (master’s level) psychologist trained in motivational interviewing and other cognitive-behavioral strategies. I offer education, practical skills and resources to help you find relief from mental health symptoms while we build a secure therapeutic relationship. Those who have experienced multiple traumas or chronic stress in life can benefit from my experience with dialectical behavioral therapy, emotion-focused therapy and psychodynamic insights.</p>

                    <p>I have had the privilege of working with people from both urban and rural settings, entrepreneurs and unemployed, felons and victims, spiritual and skeptical, athletes and injured, healthy and chronically ill. It is vital that your therapy experience be tailored to your values, symptoms and life experiences. I strive to take your unique perspective and work with you to remove the obstacles preventing your recovery and personal growth.</p>

                <p><strong>It is normal to be hesitant about seeking treatment.</strong> We often feel like we should be able to handle life on our own. It can be helpful, however, to have a mental health check-up. Many people are relieved to find that others can relate to their experience and that psychotherapy can foster both relief from current symptoms and strength to live life more fully. Adult psychotherapy concerns I address:</p>

                <h3>How much does therapy/counseling cost?</h3>
                <p>If you have insurance coverage for outpatient psychotherapy, you might be responsible for a copay between $20 and $50 (just an estimate). Other plans require you to pay your deductible first. If you have Medicaid, treatment is often free.</p>

                <p>Call your insurance company to learn about your coverage, your copay and if there is a limit on sessions. The most helpful phone number is the one on the back of your insurance card. If you do not have insurance, a sliding scale from $50-100 is available based on your income.</p>

                <h3>What should I expect from the first session with Ian?</h3>
                <p>During the first session you will be able to share your main concerns, and I will gather information helpful in seeing the big picture of your life. This means asking a lot of questions to help assess your situation. After the initial assessment is done, we can identify practical, first steps and develop long-term goals. Here, I will be asking fewer questions and doing more listening. Motivation for lasting change must come from within you so it is important for me to understand the real you. Together we will decide how to make the best use of your time.</p>

            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>I have always been a bit absent-minded, forgetting why I opened the pantry door. “What was I going to get?" My mind is often distracted with life’s more difficult questions, which is why I've been talking with friends and family since elementary school about what’s important in life. My desire to understand how we can change, recover and overcome led me to South Carolina, where I majored in both psychology and biblical studies (in addition to minors in the humanities and intercultural studies).</p>
            <p>While in college I met Genevieve, who amazed me with her musical talents and integrity of character. Genevieve and I soon married and moved to Grand Rapids, MI. I began working with adults who have chronic mental illness at Cherry Street Health Services, coaching them on skills for living and working while building a sense of community in the program. During this time I chose to specialize in psychotherapy as a career and completed a Masters in Counseling Psychology from Western Michigan University. My time at Western was challenging and fulfilling. Few things fill me with a sense of wonder like studying the complexity of the human design and the mystery of the human condition.</p>
            <p>While completing my training at WMU, our son, Graydon was born, becoming the joy of our family. I began working at the Pine Rest Christian Mental Health Services* after graduate school in order to serve people in distress by offering a therapy experience of acceptance, sensitivity, hope and courage for change.</p>
