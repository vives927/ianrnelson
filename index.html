            <p>I was an absent-minded kid, always forgetting why I opened the pantry door. â€œWhat was I going to get?" My mind was often distracted with the greater questions in life, which is why I've been talking with people about life's troubles since grade school. My desire to understand life and people led me to South Carolina, where I majored in both psychology and biblical studies (in addition to minors in the humanities and intercultural studies).</p>
            <p>While in college I met Genevieve, who amazed me with her musical talents and integrity of character. Genevieve and I soon married and moved to Grand Rapids, MI. I began working with adults who have chronic mental illness at Cherry Street Health Services, coaching them on skills for living and working while building a sense of community in the program. During this time I chose to specialize in psychotherapy as a career and completed a Masters in Counseling Psychology from Western Michigan University. I loved every minute of it. Few things fill me with a sense of wonder like studying the complexity of the human design and the mystery of the human condition.</p>
            <p>While completing my training at WMU, our son, Graydon was born, becoming the joy of our family. I began working at the Pine Rest Christian Mental Health Services* after graduate school in order to serve people in distress by offering a therapy experience of acceptance, sensitivity, hope and courage for change.</p>

            <p><strong>It is normal to be hesitant about seeking treatment.</strong> We often feel like we should be able to handle life on our own. It can be helpful, however, to have a mental health check-up. Many people are relieved to find that others can relate to their experience and that psychotherapy can foster both relief from current symptoms and strength to live life more fully. Adult psychotherapy concerns I address:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anxiety</li>
                <li>Depression and Mood Disorders</li>
                <li>Stress and Anger Management</li>
                <li>Substance Use Concerns</li>
                <li>Trauma and PTSD</li>
                <li>Relationship Issues</li>
                <li>Spiritual Concerns</li>

            <h3>How much does therapy/counseling cost?</h3>
            <p>If you have Medicaid, treatment is often free. Accepted Medicaid plans are: McLaren Commercial, McLaren Medicaid, Meridian Medicaid, ASR Health Benefits.</p>
            <p>If you have insurance coverage for outpatient psychotherapy, you might be responsible for a copay between $20 and $50 (just an estimate). Other plans require you to pay your deductible first. Call your insurance company to learn about your coverage, your copay and if there is a limit on sessions. The most helpful phone number is the one on the back of your insurance card. If you do not have insurance, a sliding scale from $50-100 is available based on your income.</p>

            <h3>What should I expect from the first session with Ian?</h3>
            <p>During the first session you will be able to share your main concerns, and I will gather information helpful in seeing the big picture of your life. This means asking a lot of questions to help assess your situation. After the initial assessment is done, we can identify practical, first steps and develop long-term goals. Here, I will be asking fewer questions and doing more listening. Motivation for lasting change must come from within you so it is important for me to understand the real you. Together we will decide how to make the best use of your time.</p>
