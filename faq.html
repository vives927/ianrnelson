				<p>Seeing a counselor or psychologist is almost always the right decision if you are feeling overwhelmed, out of control or having thoughts about hurting yourself. If you find yourself in less severe distress you may be able to manage life without seeing a mental health professional. For most people, though, there comes a point when they just decide that they want something different in life: "I'm tired of feeling this way" or "I miss who I used to be" or "I just want to be more alive in life." Part of making that desire a reality can be the coaching, assessment and relationship experienced in the process of psychotherapy.</p>

				<p>Take comfort in knowing that most therapists and counselors provide excellent service. So you will benefit in different ways from different personalities and styles. </p>
				<p>There are a two important factors that can set limits on your therapy experience: finances and severity of symptoms. If you are limited by finances or insurance coverage to only a handful of sessions, it may be helpful to focus on a specific problem or goal to make the best use of your time. A professional who uses <a href="#" class="link_tooltip" title="There are many different therapies that fall in this category. What they have in common is a focus on changing thoughts and beliefs that are inaccurate or unhelpful. These therapies also focus directly on problematic behaviors and practical ways to change them. Many therapies have been standardized by using treatment manuals that usually take between 8 and 20 sessions to complete. This makes researching their effectiveness easier. There are many CBT therapies validated by research for specific problems, most commonly depression, phobias, and other anxiety disorders.">cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</a> or <a class="link_tooltip" href="#" title="In this approach, little time is spent talking about the past or any issue that is not directly related to a solution. The focus is on where the client wants to be and how to get there, rather than exploring symptoms or past experiences. A clear vision of a desirable future is developed and practical steps are taken to make it a reality.">solution-focused brief therapy (SFBT)</a> may be a good fit. These therapies tend to have more structure in the session and direction from the therapist. "Homework assignments" may be given between sessions. If your symptoms are severe or overwhelming, this may also be a good approach to start with. The structure and focus on specific outcomes can reduce the sense of being overwhelmed.</p>
				<p>If you are not limited to a few sessions or are interested in more global, personality change, you may want to consider a therapist who identifies themselves as client-centered, <a href="#" class="link_tooltip" title="There are a few given truths about life: death is inevitable, the only one inside your head is you (we are isolated from each other), we are responsible for our decisions and we all long for meaning. These realities of existence bring up questions we all must answer at some point. There are times in therapy when talking about these realities can greatly help the process.">existential</a>, or psychodynamic. These approaches tend to be less <a href="#" class="link_tooltip" title="In a directive approach to therapy, the therapist directs the content of the session and takes the lead in assessing your situation and offering treatment options. Therapists that are more directive often have expertise in teaching clients particular skills for reducing symptoms and changing problematic behaviors. In non-directive therapy, the therapist allows the client to direct the content of the session and identify treatment options. Non-directive therapists tend to be excellent listeners, allowing clients to connect with their innate ability for growth. Most therapist describe themselves as collaborative, recognizing that direction from both the therapist and client is needed for effective treatment.">directive</a>, more client-led and more direct attention is given to the relationship between you and your therapist. </p>
				<p>Please note that many therapists draw upon a number of theories to form a good fit for their own personality and skill set. They can be flexible in their approach. Many CBT therapists would describe themselves as <a href="#" class="link_tooltip" title="Client-centered therapy allows the client to lead (non-directive) and emphasizes the innate ability of the client to grow.

Early childhood experiences are often explored since these shape a person in profound and lasting ways.">psychodynamic</a> therapists can offer more directive therapy depending on your needs. </p>
				<p>Finally, if your symptoms closely match a diagnose (e.g. panic attacks, clinical depression, PTSD, social phobia, etc.) then it will be helpful to find a therapist who has specific experience with that diagnosis.</p>

			<div class="accHead">What should I expect from the first few sessions? <span class="arrow">&#x25BC;</span></div>
			<div class="accBody">
				<p>I offer a therapy experience that allows clients to be their true selves and find reassurance that they are not alone with their concerns. It is important to feel accepted and safe in order to begin the process. During the first and second session, you will be able to share your main concerns and I will gather information helpful in seeing the big picture of your life. This means asking a lot of questions to help assess your situation.</p> 
				<p>After the initial assessment is done, we will try to identify some practical first steps and develop some long-term goals. Here, I will be asking fewer questions and doing more listening. Motivation for lasting change must come from within you so it is important for me to understand the real you. Together we will decide how to make the best use of your time.</p>

				<p>Almost everyone finds something helpful about a therapy experience. The first thing that therapy can help you with is clarifying what is really bothering you and what you really want (we often want more than one thing. i.e. I want to be with her and I want my space). Secondly, therapy can give you insight into how you got here in life and why you do what you do. Now, what most people want to know is will it change your symptoms, emotions, behavior or relationship? </p>
				<p>What we know from experience (research) is that the relationship between you and your therapist makes the biggest difference. So it is important to find a good match between you and your therapist or counselor. Now don’t take this the wrong way, you and your therapist will always have differences. Working through these difference is how we grow. So you and your therapist do not need to share the same views. However, if you feel strongly that your therapist and you are not connecting after a few sessions, you may want to consider trying another person. </p>
				<p>Another significant factor is your own readiness to change. This means, that your desire to change has to be strong enough to do the work of therapy and take the risks of therapy. This usually means facing some of your fears and making significant changes to your routine and your relationships. Some therapies have many "homework assignments" or "experiments" that require some diligence. Others have very little homework. Being prepared to try new things can make a big difference in the outcome of therapy.</p>

			<div class="accBody">
				<p>I am licensed as a Temporary Limited-Licensed Psychologist. A Licensed Psychologist (LP) has a doctorate. A Limited-Licensed Psychologist (LLP) has a masters degree and is supervised by an LP. Every LLP starts with a TLLP while gaining more expertise in their psychological field. After I complete more work as a psychotherapist, I will drop the "Temporary" and continue as an LLP.</p>

			<div class="accHead">What is the difference between a psychologist, a counselor and a social worker? <span class="arrow">&#x25BC;</span></div>
			<div class="accBody">
				<p>A particular license is not as important as the personality and skill of the therapist. There are a few significant differences between licenses, but these are mostly academic. It is the experience, skill, personality and counseling approach that makes one therapist or counselor different from the next. However, it may be important to know that psychological testing and assessment can only be done by psychologists. (A licensed psychologist, LP, has a doctorate. A limited licensed psychologist, LLP, has a masters and is supervised by an LP). Still, plenty of helpful surveys can be used by professionals of all licenses. </p>
				<p>Licensed professional counselors (LPCs) have a similar (master's level) academic experience to psychologists. Licensed marriage and family therapists (LMFTs) also earn a master of arts, with the appropriate focus on marriage and family therapy. Social work degrees (BSW, MSW) focus more on mental health policy, advocacy and community resources, but students have the option to focus on <a href="#" class="link_tooltip" title="I use these terms interchangeably. Counseling is sometimes thought of as a less in-depth process, like consulting someone for advice or direction. Psychological therapy (psychotherapy) can have the connotation of deeper, personality change. However, in practice it is difficult to make a clear distinction since people experience profound change from both counseling and psychotherapy. Most mental health professionals are flexible, providing mostly counsel to some clients and mostly therapy to others.">counseling and psychotherapy</a> as well. These academic differences tend to be less important than other factors when choosing a psychotherapist.</p>
				<p>I am in the LLP category, having completed a master's degree in counseling psychology. I practice under a Licensed Psychologist (LP) with a temporary limited license for psychology (TLLP). After a few more years of experience, I can drop the "T" but will continue to practice under an LP, according to Michigan licensure laws.</p>
