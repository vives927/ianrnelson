		<p><em>It is normal to be hesitant about seeking treatment. We often feel like we should be able to handle life on our own.</em> It can be helpful, however, to have a mental health check-up. Many people are relieved to find that others can relate to their experience and that psychotherapy can foster both relief from current symptoms and strength to live life more fully.</p>
		<p>If you are experiencing any symptoms related to anxiety, stress, depression, trauma, PTSD or concerns about substance use, <em>it could be time to contact myself or another professional for a consultation and assessment.</em> In addition, many relationship and spiritual concerns can be explored in therapy, offering you a safe place to be your true self and work through the fears and questions we all have in common. Finally, I offer support to those preparing for cross-cultural work outside the U.S. and those transitioning from cross-cultural work. Working through culture shock and re-adjusting to life in the states is a formidable challenge.</p>
